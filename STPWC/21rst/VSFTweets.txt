As the winner of the Vienna Science Fair 2021, Lolezio Viora-Marguet, Grade 12 student 
@VIS_Austria
was invited to Borealis Innovation Centre Linz. At Borealis, Lolezio explored various labs, 
talked to scientists, and used his teamwork skills to solve some science problems!
First time at #EGU22 as Editorial Manager... Being back in Vienna was a blast! Met 
old and new colleagues, enjoyed talking open access, open science and EDI. Also 
had time to see some cool science... fair to say my head is buzzing with ideas. 
#EGU22 insprirational as always!
