1. SHEET
With everyone dead, I started here on my own
with my ak-47 my brother of steel,

no one comes to wash and comb me and I don’t fetch wood
for anyone here, everything comes from the soldiers

who are fond of me because I bring them luck and
am good at chucking grenades.

In front of us lies the town where nobody lives
and I look down, fix my brother’s gaze on the roofs, 

then we keep watch, first of all on the house of my uncle
who strung himself up because he could only still talk to the dead. 

My brother is as big as me but I hold him securely
on my shoulder where he can sleep 

and my uncle’s window is open, a sheet billows out
on the balcony and there’s no wind and no one is hanging 

washing on the line there, so I shoot and
it falls to the ground. It doesn’t look like a sheet.
