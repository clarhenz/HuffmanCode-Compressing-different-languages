winter
It was not for this that we awoke. Stark trees, yes, and the hour of your coming it was. Like lightning through the grove. It was but a slaughter of bees travelling fast. Travelling still. And beyond the hill Mother Englandâ€”fighting on her ship at sea. Our homeward vessel moored and bound. Harder and greener and further away the land. Slower the tides. The brackish water. The too-long winter. Nested into itself the coming spring. Travelling slow. Swallows and dying and a flight into stillness we go. We go. Into the pilgrim light. With a frame of bones to mark. The edge of the sky from time.
