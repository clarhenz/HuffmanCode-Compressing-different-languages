When shadows lengthen and the day grows dim,
Within the chambers of the human heart,
Emotions stir, both bright and dark, within,
A tempest swirling, tearing life apart.

For love, a gentle breeze that softly blows,
Can lift the soul to heights beyond compare,
Yet also, like a thorn, it pricks and stows,
Leaving behind a wound so raw and bare.

In joy, the world seems bathed in golden light,
Each moment precious, cherished, full of grace,
But sorrow, like a cloud, obscures the sight,
And leaves behind a bitter, cold embrace.

Yet in this dance of feelings, wild and free,
We find the essence of our humanity.
