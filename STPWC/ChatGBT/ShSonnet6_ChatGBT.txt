When winter's breath doth chill the earth below,
And frosty tendrils cling to branch and bough,
The land lies quiet 'neath its cloak of snow,
As icy winds across the landscape plow.

The trees stand bare, their leaves now long since shed,
Yet beauty lies in winter's stark embrace,
For in the hush, a peaceful calm is spread,
And nature finds a tranquil resting place.

The hearth's warm glow invites us to draw near,
As firelight dances in the dark of night,
And in its flicker, we find comfort clear,
A refuge from the cold and bitter bite.

Though winter's grip may seem too harsh, too cold,
'Tis but a season in life's story told.
