Upon the canvas of the morning's light,
Where dew-kissed petals softly start to bloom,
A symphony of colors pure and bright,
Each dawn unveils the earth's eternal loom.

In whispered winds that dance through fields of gold,
There lies a melody of nature's song,
Where stories ancient and untold unfold,
In rustling leaves where dreams and hopes belong.

Yet as the sun descends 'neath twilight's shroud,
And stars emerge to paint the velvet sky,
We find in darkness, love's embrace endowed,
As hearts entwine beneath the moon on high.

So let us cherish moments swift and fleet,
In nature's arms, where love and beauty meet.
