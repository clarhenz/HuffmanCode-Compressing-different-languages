When autumn's breath doth paint the leaves in gold,
And crimson hues adorn the forest's cloak,
The world transforms as nature's tale unfolds,
In whispered secrets that the wind evokes.

The trees, ablaze with fire, their colors flare,
As sunsets cast a soft and amber glow,
A fleeting beauty in the crisp, cool air,
As earth prepares for winter's silent snow.

The harvest moon, a beacon in the night,
Guides lovers' steps along the path they roam,
While memories of summer take their flight,
In autumn's embrace, they find a new home.

Oh, autumn's grace, thy melancholy sigh,
In every leaf that falls, a lullaby.
