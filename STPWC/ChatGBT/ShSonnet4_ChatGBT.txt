Amidst the tapestry of twilight's hue,
Where shadows dance in evening's soft embrace,
I find myself entranced by thoughts of you,
Lost in the echoes of your gentle grace.

With every breath, a sonnet I compose,
Each syllable a tribute to your name,
In whispered verses, love forever flows,
A melody that kindles passion's flame.

As stars adorn the canopy above,
Their twinkling light a witness to our plight,
We're bound by threads of fate and woven love,
A timeless bond that knows no end in sight.

So let us revel in this sweet refrain,
Forever bound by love's enduring chain.
