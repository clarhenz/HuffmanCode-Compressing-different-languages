Upon the stage of life, love takes its cue,
A tender dance beneath the moon's soft light,
In whispered vows and promises anew,
Two souls entwined, bound by love's sacred rite.

Through tempests wild and calm, love's flame shall burn,
In every glance, a sonnet softly sung,
With every touch, a verse, a sweet return,
In passion's fire, two hearts become one.

Though time may weave its threads of joy and pain,
And shadows cast their veil upon the way,
In love's embrace, we find our true domain,
Where doubts dissolve and fears begin to sway.

So let us revel in love's sweet refrain,
For in its depths, eternity we gain.
