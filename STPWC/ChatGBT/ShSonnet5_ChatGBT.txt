When winter's grip begins to gently wane,
And sunlight kisses earth with warming grace,
Awakening from slumber, nature's reign,
In spring's arrival, we find solace trace.

The buds unfurl, a symphony of green,
As blossoms bloom in colors bright and fair,
Soft whispers of the breeze, a joyful scene,
Perfuming air with fragrances rare.

In meadows green, where laughter softly sings,
And gentle streams meander on their way,
The earth rejoices as new life it brings,
In every dawn of this enchanting day.

Oh, let us dance amidst the springtime's cheer,
And cherish moments as they draw near.
