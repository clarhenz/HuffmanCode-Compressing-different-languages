Upon the stage of life, we dance our part,
In shadows cast by fate's relentless hand,
Through joy and sorrow, love's sweet piercing dart,
We wander lost in this mysterious land.
With words as weapons, we doth wage our wars,
In whispers soft or thunderous cries of rage,
Yet underneath, love's gentle music soars,
A symphony that doth our souls engage.
Oh, how the stars above doth twinkle bright,
Aglow with secrets from the heavens high,
They watch our plight, our struggles in the night,
And weave our tales beneath the midnight sky.
So let us play our roles upon this stage,
For life's grand script is writ on every page.
