When colors blend upon the canvas bright,
And strokes of passion tell a tale untold,
In art's embrace, we find a guiding light,
A mirror to the stories yet unfold.

With every brushstroke, worlds are born anew,
In hues that dance upon the artist's hand,
Each stroke a whisper, every shade a clue,
To truths that only art can understand.

Through masterpieces crafted with such care,
The artist's soul speaks in its silent tongue,
In every line and curve, a love affair,
With beauty found where once was darkness hung.

So let us cherish art in all its grace,
For in its depths, we find a sacred space.
