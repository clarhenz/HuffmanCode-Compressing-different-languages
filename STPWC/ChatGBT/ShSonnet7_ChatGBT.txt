When summer's sun with golden light doth rise,
And fields of green stretch out as far as sight,
The earth awakes 'neath blue and endless skies,
In nature's splendor, bathed in pure delight.

The gentle breeze, a lover's soft caress,
Whispers secrets through the leaves' green veil,
As flowers bloom in hues of deep finesse,
And songbirds fill the air with sweet travail.

In meadows lush, where lazy rivers flow,
And laughter echoes in the noonday heat,
Each moment seems to bask in golden glow,
As time itself finds solace and retreat.

Oh, summer's reign, so fleeting, yet so fair,
In memories sweet, thy warmth shall linger there.
