ACT I
SCENE I. An open Place.
Thunder and Lightning. Enter three Witches.

FIRST WITCH.
When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

SECOND WITCH.
When the hurlyburlyís done,
When the battleís lost and won.

THIRD WITCH.
That will be ere the set of sun.

FIRST WITCH.
Where the place?

SECOND WITCH.
Upon the heath.

THIRD WITCH.
There to meet with Macbeth.

FIRST WITCH.
I come, Graymalkin!

SECOND WITCH.
Paddock calls.

THIRD WITCH.
Anon.

ALL.
Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
Hover through the fog and filthy air.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE II. A Camp near Forres.
Alarum within. Enter King Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Captain.

DUNCAN.
What bloody man is that? He can report,
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
The newest state.

MALCOLM.
This is the sergeant
Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought
íGainst my captivity.óHail, brave friend!
Say to the King the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it.

SOLDIER.
Doubtful it stood;
As two spent swimmers that do cling together
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald
(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
The multiplying villainies of nature
Do swarm upon him) from the Western Isles
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Showíd like a rebelís whore. But allís too weak;
For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),
Disdaining Fortune, with his brandishíd steel,
Which smokíd with bloody execution,
Like Valourís minion, carvíd out his passage,
Till he facíd the slave;
Which neíer shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Till he unseamíd him from the nave to the chops,
And fixíd his head upon our battlements.

DUNCAN.
O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!

SOLDIER.
As whence the sun ígins his reflection
Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break,
So from that spring, whence comfort seemíd to come
Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:
No sooner justice had, with valour armíd,
Compellíd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,
With furbishíd arms and new supplies of men,
Began a fresh assault.

DUNCAN.
Dismayíd not this
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?

SOLDIER.
Yes;
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
If I say sooth, I must report they were
As cannons overchargíd with double cracks;
So they
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
Or memorize another Golgotha,
I cannot telló
But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.

DUNCAN.
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds:
They smack of honour both.óGo, get him surgeons.

[Exit Captain, attended.]

Enter Ross and Angus.

Who comes here?

MALCOLM.
The worthy Thane of Ross.

LENNOX.
What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
That seems to speak things strange.

ROSS.
God save the King!

DUNCAN.
Whence camíst thou, worthy thane?

ROSS.
From Fife, great King,
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold.
Norway himself, with terrible numbers,
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,
The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
Till that Bellonaís bridegroom, lappíd in proof,
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
Point against point, rebellious arm ígainst arm,
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
The victory fell on us.

DUNCAN.
Great happiness!

ROSS.
That now
Sweno, the Norwaysí king, craves composition;
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed at Saint Colmeís Inch
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.

DUNCAN.
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,
And with his former title greet Macbeth.

ROSS.
Iíll see it done.

DUNCAN.
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE III. A heath.
Thunder. Enter the three Witches.

FIRST WITCH.
Where hast thou been, sister?

SECOND WITCH.
Killing swine.

THIRD WITCH.
Sister, where thou?

FIRST WITCH.
A sailorís wife had chestnuts in her lap,
And mounchíd, and mounchíd, and mounchíd. ìGive me,î quoth I.
ìAroint thee, witch!î the rump-fed ronyon cries.
Her husbandís to Aleppo gone, master oí thí Tiger:
But in a sieve Iíll thither sail,
And, like a rat without a tail,
Iíll do, Iíll do, and Iíll do.

SECOND WITCH.
Iíll give thee a wind.

FIRST WITCH.
Thíart kind.

THIRD WITCH.
And I another.

FIRST WITCH.
I myself have all the other,
And the very ports they blow,
All the quarters that they know
Ií the shipmanís card.
I will drain him dry as hay:
Sleep shall neither night nor day
Hang upon his pent-house lid;
He shall live a man forbid.
Weary sevín-nights nine times nine,
Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine:
Though his bark cannot be lost,
Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
Look what I have.

SECOND WITCH.
Show me, show me.

FIRST WITCH.
Here I have a pilotís thumb,
Wrackíd as homeward he did come.

[Drum within.]

THIRD WITCH.
A drum, a drum!
Macbeth doth come.

ALL.
The Weird Sisters, hand in hand,
Posters of the sea and land,
Thus do go about, about:
Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
And thrice again, to make up nine.
Peace!óthe charmís wound up.

Enter Macbeth and Banquo.

MACBETH.
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.

BANQUO.
How far isít callíd to Forres?óWhat are these,
So witheríd, and so wild in their attire,
That look not like the inhabitants oí thí earth,
And yet are onít?óLive you? or are you aught
That man may question? You seem to understand me,
By each at once her choppy finger laying
Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
That you are so.

MACBETH.
Speak, if you can;ówhat are you?

FIRST WITCH.
All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!

SECOND WITCH.
All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!

THIRD WITCH.
All hail, Macbeth! that shalt be king hereafter!

BANQUO.
Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fair?óIí thí name of truth,
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
You greet with present grace and great prediction
Of noble having and of royal hope,
That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.
If you can look into the seeds of time,
And say which grain will grow, and which will not,
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
Your favours nor your hate.

FIRST WITCH.
Hail!

SECOND WITCH.
Hail!

THIRD WITCH.
Hail!

FIRST WITCH.
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.

SECOND WITCH.
Not so happy, yet much happier.

THIRD WITCH.
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!

FIRST WITCH.
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!

MACBETH.
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.
By Sinelís death I know I am Thane of Glamis;
But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
Stands not within the prospect of belief,
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
You owe this strange intelligence? or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting?óSpeak, I charge you.

[Witches vanish.]

BANQUO.
The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
And these are of them. Whither are they vanishíd?

MACBETH.
Into the air; and what seemíd corporal,
Melted as breath into the wind.
Would they had stayíd!

BANQUO.
Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner?

MACBETH.
Your children shall be kings.

BANQUO.
You shall be king.

MACBETH.
And Thane of Cawdor too; went it not so?

BANQUO.
To the selfsame tune and words. Whoís here?

Enter Ross and Angus.

ROSS.
The King hath happily receivíd, Macbeth,
The news of thy success, and when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebelsí fight,
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his: silencíd with that,
In viewing oíer the rest oí thí selfsame day,
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
Strange images of death. As thick as tale
Came post with post; and everyone did bear
Thy praises in his kingdomís great defence,
And pouríd them down before him.

ANGUS.
We are sent
To give thee from our royal master thanks;
Only to herald thee into his sight,
Not pay thee.

ROSS.
And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,
For it is thine.

BANQUO.
What, can the devil speak true?

MACBETH.
The Thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
In borrowíd robes?

ANGUS.
Who was the Thane lives yet,
But under heavy judgement bears that life
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combiníd
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
He labouríd in his countryís wrack, I know not;
But treasons capital, confessíd and províd,
Have overthrown him.

MACBETH.
[Aside.] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor:
The greatest is behind. [To Ross and Angus.] Thanks for your pains.
[To Banquo.] Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
Promisíd no less to them?

BANQUO.
That, trusted home,
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But ítis strange:
And oftentimes to win us to our harm,
The instruments of darkness tell us truths;
Win us with honest trifles, to betrayís
In deepest consequence.ó
Cousins, a word, I pray you.

MACBETH.
[Aside.] Two truths are told,
As happy prologues to the swelling act
Of the imperial theme.óI thank you, gentlemen.ó
[Aside.] This supernatural soliciting
Cannot be ill; cannot be good. If ill,
Why hath it given me earnest of success,
Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor:
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
Against the use of nature? Present fears
Are less than horrible imaginings.
My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
Shakes so my single state of man
That function is smotheríd in surmise,
And nothing is but what is not.

BANQUO.
Look, how our partnerís rapt.

MACBETH.
[Aside.] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me
Without my stir.

BANQUO.
New honours come upon him,
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
But with the aid of use.

MACBETH.
[Aside.] Come what come may,
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.

BANQUO.
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.

MACBETH.
Give me your favour. My dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
Are registeríd where every day I turn
The leaf to read them.óLet us toward the King.ó
Think upon what hath chancíd; and at more time,
The interim having weighíd it, let us speak
Our free hearts each to other.

BANQUO.
Very gladly.

MACBETH.
Till then, enough.óCome, friends.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE IV. Forres. A Room in the Palace.
Flourish. Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox and Attendants.

DUNCAN.
Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
Those in commission yet returníd?

MALCOLM.
My liege,
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
With one that saw him die, who did report,
That very frankly he confessíd his treasons,
Imploríd your Highnessí pardon, and set forth
A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
Became him like the leaving it; he died
As one that had been studied in his death,
To throw away the dearest thing he owíd
As ítwere a careless trifle.

DUNCAN.
Thereís no art
To find the mindís construction in the face:
He was a gentleman on whom I built
An absolute trust.

Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross and Angus.

O worthiest cousin!
The sin of my ingratitude even now
Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before,
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deservíd;
That the proportion both of thanks and payment
Might have been mine! only I have left to say,
More is thy due than more than all can pay.

MACBETH.
The service and the loyalty I owe,
In doing it, pays itself. Your Highnessí part
Is to receive our duties: and our duties
Are to your throne and state, children and servants;
Which do but what they should, by doing everything
Safe toward your love and honour.

DUNCAN.
Welcome hither:
I have begun to plant thee, and will labour
To make thee full of growing.óNoble Banquo,
That hast no less deservíd, nor must be known
No less to have done so, let me infold thee
And hold thee to my heart.

BANQUO.
There if I grow,
The harvest is your own.

DUNCAN.
My plenteous joys,
Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
In drops of sorrow.óSons, kinsmen, thanes,
And you whose places are the nearest, know,
We will establish our estate upon
Our eldest, Malcolm; whom we name hereafter
The Prince of Cumberland: which honour must
Not unaccompanied invest him only,
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
On all deservers.óFrom hence to Inverness,
And bind us further to you.

MACBETH.
The rest is labour, which is not usíd for you:
Iíll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful
The hearing of my wife with your approach;
So, humbly take my leave.

DUNCAN.
My worthy Cawdor!

MACBETH.
[Aside.] The Prince of Cumberland!óThat is a step
On which I must fall down, or else oíerleap,
For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires!
Let not light see my black and deep desires.
The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be,
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.

[Exit.]

DUNCAN.
True, worthy Banquo! He is full so valiant;
And in his commendations I am fed.
It is a banquet to me. Letís after him,
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
It is a peerless kinsman.

[Flourish. Exeunt.]

SCENE V. Inverness. A Room in Macbethís Castle.
Enter Lady Macbeth, reading a letter.

LADY MACBETH.
ìThey met me in the day of success; and I have learned by the perfectíst report they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the King, who all-hailed me, ëThane of Cawdorí; by which title, before, these Weird Sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time, with ëHail, king that shalt be!í This have I thought good to deliver thee (my dearest partner of greatness) that thou mightíst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promisíd thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.î

Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
What thou art promisíd. Yet do I fear thy nature;
It is too full oí thí milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;
Art not without ambition, but without
The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thouídst have, great Glamis,
That which cries, ìThus thou must do,î if thou have it;
And that which rather thou dost fear to do,
Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,
And chastise with the valour of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crowníd withal.

Enter a Messenger.

What is your tidings?

MESSENGER.
The King comes here tonight.

LADY MACBETH.
Thouírt mad to say it.
Is not thy master with him? who, wereít so,
Would have informíd for preparation.

MESSENGER.
So please you, it is true. Our thane is coming.
One of my fellows had the speed of him,
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
Than would make up his message.

LADY MACBETH.
Give him tending.
He brings great news.

[Exit Messenger.]

The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
And fill me, from the crown to the toe, top-full
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood,
Stop up thí access and passage to remorse,
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
Thí effect and it! Come to my womanís breasts,
And take my milk for gall, your murdíring ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on natureís mischief! Come, thick night,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
To cry, ìHold, hold!î

Enter Macbeth.

Great Glamis, worthy Cawdor!
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present, and I feel now
The future in the instant.

MACBETH.
My dearest love,
Duncan comes here tonight.

LADY MACBETH.
And when goes hence?

MACBETH.
Tomorrow, as he purposes.

LADY MACBETH.
O, never
Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
But be the serpent underít. He thatís coming
Must be provided for; and you shall put
This nightís great business into my dispatch;
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.

MACBETH.
We will speak further.

LADY MACBETH.
Only look up clear;
To alter favour ever is to fear.
Leave all the rest to me.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE VI. The same. Before the Castle.
Hautboys. Servants of Macbeth attending.

Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Banquo, Lennox, Macduff, Ross, Angus and Attendants.

DUNCAN.
This castle hath a pleasant seat. The air
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Unto our gentle senses.

BANQUO.
This guest of summer,
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
By his loved mansionry, that the heavenís breath
Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observíd
The air is delicate.

Enter Lady Macbeth.

DUNCAN.
See, see, our honouríd hostess!ó
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
How you shall bid God íild us for your pains,
And thank us for your trouble.

LADY MACBETH.
All our service,
In every point twice done, and then done double,
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
Your Majesty loads our house: for those of old,
And the late dignities heapíd up to them,
We rest your hermits.

DUNCAN.
Whereís the Thane of Cawdor?
We coursíd him at the heels, and had a purpose
To be his purveyor: but he rides well;
And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
We are your guest tonight.

LADY MACBETH.
Your servants ever
Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt,
To make their audit at your Highnessí pleasure,
Still to return your own.

DUNCAN.
Give me your hand;
Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,
And shall continue our graces towards him.
By your leave, hostess.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE VII. The same. A Lobby in the Castle.
Hautboys and torches. Enter, and pass over, a Sewer and divers Servants with dishes and service. Then enter Macbeth.

MACBETH.
If it were done when ítis done, then ítwere well
It were done quickly. If thí assassination
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
With his surcease success; that but this blow
Might be the be-all and the end-allóhere,
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
Weíd jump the life to come. But in these cases
We still have judgement here; that we but teach
Bloody instructions, which being taught, return
To plague thí inventor. This even-handed justice
Commends thí ingredience of our poisoníd chalice
To our own lips. Heís here in double trust:
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
Who should against his murderer shut the door,
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
So clear in his great office, that his virtues
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
The deep damnation of his taking-off;
And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
Striding the blast, or heavenís cherubin, horsíd
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
That tears shall drown the wind.óI have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which oíerleaps itself
And falls on thí otheró

Enter Lady Macbeth.

How now! what news?

LADY MACBETH.
He has almost suppíd. Why have you left the chamber?

MACBETH.
Hath he askíd for me?

LADY MACBETH.
Know you not he has?

MACBETH.
We will proceed no further in this business:
He hath honouríd me of late; and I have bought
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
Not cast aside so soon.

LADY MACBETH.
Was the hope drunk
Wherein you dressíd yourself? Hath it slept since?
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
At what it did so freely? From this time
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
To be the same in thine own act and valour
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
Which thou esteemíst the ornament of life,
And live a coward in thine own esteem,
Letting ìI dare notî wait upon ìI would,î
Like the poor cat ií thí adage?

MACBETH.
Príythee, peace!
I dare do all that may become a man;
Who dares do more is none.

LADY MACBETH.
What beast wasít, then,
That made you break this enterprise to me?
When you durst do it, then you were a man;
And, to be more than what you were, you would
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
How tender ítis to love the babe that milks me:
I would, while it was smiling in my face,
Have pluckíd my nipple from his boneless gums
And dashíd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
Have done to this.

MACBETH.
If we should fail?

LADY MACBETH.
We fail?
But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
And weíll not fail. When Duncan is asleep
(Whereto the rather shall his dayís hard journey
Soundly invite him), his two chamberlains
Will I with wine and wassail so convince
That memory, the warder of the brain,
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
What cannot you and I perform upon
Thí unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
His spongy officers; who shall bear the guilt
Of our great quell?

MACBETH.
Bring forth men-children only;
For thy undaunted mettle should compose
Nothing but males. Will it not be receivíd,
When we have markíd with blood those sleepy two
Of his own chamber, and usíd their very daggers,
That they have doneít?

LADY MACBETH.
Who dares receive it other,
As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
Upon his death?

MACBETH.
I am settled, and bend up
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.

[Exeunt.]

ACT II
SCENE I. Inverness. Court within the Castle.
Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch before him.

BANQUO.
How goes the night, boy?

FLEANCE.
The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.

BANQUO.
And she goes down at twelve.

FLEANCE.
I takeít, ítis later, sir.

BANQUO.
Hold, take my sword.óThereís husbandry in heaven;
Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
And yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers,
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
Gives way to in repose!
Enter Macbeth and a Servant with a torch.

Give me my sword.óWhoís there?

MACBETH.
A friend.

BANQUO.
What, sir, not yet at rest? The Kingís abed:
He hath been in unusual pleasure and
Sent forth great largess to your offices.
This diamond he greets your wife withal,
By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up
In measureless content.

MACBETH.
Being unpreparíd,
Our will became the servant to defect,
Which else should free have wrought.

BANQUO.
Allís well.
I dreamt last night of the three Weird Sisters:
To you they have showíd some truth.

MACBETH.
I think not of them:
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
We would spend it in some words upon that business,
If you would grant the time.

BANQUO.
At your kindíst leisure.

MACBETH.
If you shall cleave to my consent, when ítis,
It shall make honour for you.

BANQUO.
So I lose none
In seeking to augment it, but still keep
My bosom franchisíd, and allegiance clear,
I shall be counsellíd.

MACBETH.
Good repose the while!

BANQUO.
Thanks, sir: the like to you.

[Exeunt Banquo and Fleance.]

MACBETH.
Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.

[Exit Servant.]

Is this a dagger which I see before me,
The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee:ó
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
I see thee yet, in form as palpable
As this which now I draw.
Thou marshallíst me the way that I was going;
And such an instrument I was to use.
Mine eyes are made the fools oí the other senses,
Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still;
And on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood,
Which was not so before.óThereís no such thing.
It is the bloody business which informs
Thus to mine eyes.óNow oíer the one half-world
Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
The curtainíd sleep. Witchcraft celebrates
Pale Hecateís offírings; and witheríd murder,
Alarumíd by his sentinel, the wolf,
Whose howlís his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,
With Tarquinís ravishing strides, towards his design
Moves like a ghost.óThou sure and firm-set earth,
Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
And take the present horror from the time,
Which now suits with it.óWhiles I threat, he lives.
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.

[A bell rings.]

I go, and it is done. The bell invites me.
Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.

[Exit.]

SCENE II. The same.
Enter Lady Macbeth.

LADY MACBETH.
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold:
What hath quenchíd them hath given me fire.óHark!óPeace!
It was the owl that shriekíd, the fatal bellman,
Which gives the sterníst good night. He is about it.
The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores: I have druggíd their possets,
That death and nature do contend about them,
Whether they live or die.

MACBETH.
[Within.] Whoís there?ówhat, ho!

LADY MACBETH.
Alack! I am afraid they have awakíd,
And ítis not done. Thí attempt and not the deed
Confounds us.óHark!óI laid their daggers ready;
He could not miss íem.óHad he not resembled
My father as he slept, I had doneít.óMy husband!

Enter Macbeth.

MACBETH.
I have done the deed.óDidst thou not hear a noise?

LADY MACBETH.
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Did not you speak?

MACBETH.
When?

LADY MACBETH.
Now.

MACBETH.
As I descended?

LADY MACBETH.
Ay.

MACBETH.
Hark!óWho lies ií thí second chamber?

LADY MACBETH.
Donalbain.

MACBETH.
This is a sorry sight.

[Looking on his hands.]

LADY MACBETH.
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.

MACBETH.
Thereís one did laugh inís sleep, and one cried, ìMurder!î
That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them.
But they did say their prayers, and addressíd them
Again to sleep.

LADY MACBETH.
There are two lodgíd together.

MACBETH.
One cried, ìGod bless us!î and, ìAmen,î the other,
As they had seen me with these hangmanís hands.
Listíning their fear, I could not say ìAmen,î
When they did say, ìGod bless us.î

LADY MACBETH.
Consider it not so deeply.

MACBETH.
But wherefore could not I pronounce ìAmenî?
I had most need of blessing, and ìAmenî
Stuck in my throat.

LADY MACBETH.
These deeds must not be thought
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.

MACBETH.
Methought I heard a voice cry, ìSleep no more!
Macbeth does murder sleep,îóthe innocent sleep;
Sleep that knits up the ravellíd sleave of care,
The death of each dayís life, sore labourís bath,
Balm of hurt minds, great natureís second course,
Chief nourisher in lifeís feast.

LADY MACBETH.
What do you mean?

MACBETH.
Still it cried, ìSleep no more!î to all the house:
ìGlamis hath murderíd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more!î

LADY MACBETH.
Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
You do unbend your noble strength to think
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.ó
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
They must lie there: go carry them, and smear
The sleepy grooms with blood.

MACBETH.
Iíll go no more:
I am afraid to think what I have done;
Look onít again I dare not.

LADY MACBETH.
Infirm of purpose!
Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead
Are but as pictures. íTis the eye of childhood
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
Iíll gild the faces of the grooms withal,
For it must seem their guilt.

[Exit. Knocking within.]

MACBETH.
Whence is that knocking?
How isít with me, when every noise appals me?
What hands are here? Ha, they pluck out mine eyes!
Will all great Neptuneís ocean wash this blood
Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
The multitudinous seas incarnadine,
Making the green one red.

Enter Lady Macbeth.

LADY MACBETH.
My hands are of your color, but I shame
To wear a heart so white. [Knocking within.] I hear knocking
At the south entry:óretire we to our chamber.
A little water clears us of this deed:
How easy is it then! Your constancy
Hath left you unattended.ó[Knocking within.] Hark, more knocking.
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us
And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
So poorly in your thoughts.

MACBETH.
To know my deed, ítwere best not know myself. [Knocking within.]
Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!

[Exeunt.]

SCENE III. The same.
Enter a Porter. Knocking within.

PORTER.
Hereís a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell gate, he should have old turning the key. [Knocking.] Knock, knock, knock. Whoís there, ií thí name of Belzebub? Hereís a farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about you; here youíll sweat forít. [Knocking.] Knock, knock! Whoís there, ií thí other devilís name? Faith, hereís an equivocator, that could swear in both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough for Godís sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come in, equivocator. [Knocking.] Knock, knock, knock! Whoís there? Faith, hereís an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose. [Knocking.] Knock, knock. Never at quiet! What are you?óBut this place is too cold for hell. Iíll devil-porter it no further: I had thought to have let in some of all professions, that go the primrose way to thí everlasting bonfire. [Knocking.] Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.

[Opens the gate.]

Enter Macduff and Lennox.

MACDUFF.
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
That you do lie so late?

PORTER.
Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.

MACDUFF.
What three things does drink especially provoke?

PORTER.
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him.

MACDUFF.
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.

PORTER.
That it did, sir, ií the very throat on me; but I requited him for his lie; and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.

MACDUFF.
Is thy master stirring?
Enter Macbeth.

Our knocking has awakíd him; here he comes.

LENNOX.
Good morrow, noble sir!

MACBETH.
Good morrow, both!

MACDUFF.
Is the King stirring, worthy thane?

MACBETH.
Not yet.

MACDUFF.
He did command me to call timely on him.
I have almost slippíd the hour.

MACBETH.
Iíll bring you to him.

MACDUFF.
I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
But yet ítis one.

MACBETH.
The labour we delight in physics pain.
This is the door.

MACDUFF.
Iíll make so bold to call.
For ítis my limited service.

[Exit Macduff.]

LENNOX.
Goes the King hence today?

MACBETH.
He does. He did appoint so.

LENNOX.
The night has been unruly: where we lay,
Our chimneys were blown down and, as they say,
Lamentings heard ií thí air, strange screams of death,
And prophesying, with accents terrible,
Of dire combustion and confusíd events,
New hatchíd to the woeful time. The obscure bird
Clamouríd the live-long night. Some say the earth
Was feverous, and did shake.

MACBETH.
íTwas a rough night.

LENNOX.
My young remembrance cannot parallel
A fellow to it.

Enter Macduff.

MACDUFF.
O horror, horror, horror!
Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!

MACBETH, LENNOX.
Whatís the matter?

MACDUFF.
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
The Lordís anointed temple, and stole thence
The life oí thí building.

MACBETH.
What isít you say? the life?

LENNOX.
Mean you his majesty?

MACDUFF.
Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak.
See, and then speak yourselves.

[Exeunt Macbeth and Lennox.]

Awake, awake!ó
Ring the alarum bell.óMurder and treason!
Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
Shake off this downy sleep, deathís counterfeit,
And look on death itself! Up, up, and see
The great doomís image. Malcolm! Banquo!
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites
To countenance this horror!

[Alarum-bell rings.]

Enter Lady Macbeth.

LADY MACBETH.
Whatís the business,
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!

MACDUFF.
O gentle lady,
íTis not for you to hear what I can speak:
The repetition, in a womanís ear,
Would murder as it fell.

Enter Banquo.

O Banquo, Banquo!
Our royal masterís murderíd!

LADY MACBETH.
Woe, alas!
What, in our house?

BANQUO.
Too cruel anywhere.ó
Dear Duff, I príythee, contradict thyself,
And say it is not so.

Enter Macbeth and Lennox with Ross.

MACBETH.
Had I but died an hour before this chance,
I had livíd a blessed time; for, from this instant
Thereís nothing serious in mortality.
All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
Is left this vault to brag of.

Enter Malcolm and Donalbain.

DONALBAIN.
What is amiss?

MACBETH.
You are, and do not knowít:
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
Is stoppíd; the very source of it is stoppíd.

MACDUFF.
Your royal fatherís murderíd.

MALCOLM.
O, by whom?

LENNOX.
Those of his chamber, as it seemíd, had doneít:
Their hands and faces were all badgíd with blood;
So were their daggers, which, unwipíd, we found
Upon their pillows. They staríd, and were distracted;
No manís life was to be trusted with them.

MACBETH.
O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
That I did kill them.

MACDUFF.
Wherefore did you so?

MACBETH.
Who can be wise, amazíd, temperate, and furious,
Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:
Thí expedition of my violent love
Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,
His silver skin lacíd with his golden blood;
And his gashíd stabs lookíd like a breach in nature
For ruinís wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
Steepíd in the colours of their trade, their daggers
Unmannerly breechíd with gore. Who could refrain,
That had a heart to love, and in that heart
Courage to makeís love known?

LADY MACBETH.
Help me hence, ho!

MACDUFF.
Look to the lady.

MALCOLM.
Why do we hold our tongues,
That most may claim this argument for ours?

DONALBAIN.
What should be spoken here, where our fate,
Hid in an auger hole, may rush, and seize us?
Letís away. Our tears are not yet brewíd.

MALCOLM.
Nor our strong sorrow
Upon the foot of motion.

BANQUO.
Look to the lady:ó

[Lady Macbeth is carried out.]

And when we have our naked frailties hid,
That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
And question this most bloody piece of work
To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:
In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
Against the undivulgíd pretence I fight
Of treasonous malice.

MACDUFF.
And so do I.

ALL.
So all.

MACBETH.
Letís briefly put on manly readiness,
And meet ií thí hall together.

ALL.
Well contented.

[Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.]

MALCOLM.
What will you do? Letís not consort with them:
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
Which the false man does easy. Iíll to England.

DONALBAIN.
To Ireland, I. Our separated fortune
Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are,
Thereís daggers in menís smiles: the near in blood,
The nearer bloody.

MALCOLM.
This murderous shaft thatís shot
Hath not yet lighted; and our safest way
Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse;
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
But shift away. Thereís warrant in that theft
Which steals itself, when thereís no mercy left.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE IV. The same. Without the Castle.
Enter Ross and an Old Man.

OLD MAN.
Threescore and ten I can remember well,
Within the volume of which time I have seen
Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night
Hath trifled former knowings.

ROSS.
Ha, good father,
Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with manís act,
Threatens his bloody stage: by the clock ítis day,
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.
Isít nightís predominance, or the dayís shame,
That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
When living light should kiss it?

OLD MAN.
íTis unnatural,
Even like the deed thatís done. On Tuesday last,
A falcon, towering in her pride of place,
Was by a mousing owl hawkíd at and killíd.

ROSS.
And Duncanís horses (a thing most strange and certain)
Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
Turníd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
Contending ígainst obedience, as they would make
War with mankind.

OLD MAN.
íTis said they eat each other.

ROSS.
They did so; to the amazement of mine eyes,
That lookíd uponít.
Here comes the good Macduff.

Enter Macduff.

How goes the world, sir, now?

MACDUFF.
Why, see you not?

ROSS.
Isít known who did this more than bloody deed?

MACDUFF.
Those that Macbeth hath slain.

ROSS.
Alas, the day!
What good could they pretend?

MACDUFF.
They were suborníd.
Malcolm and Donalbain, the Kingís two sons,
Are stolín away and fled; which puts upon them
Suspicion of the deed.

ROSS.
íGainst nature still:
Thriftless ambition, that will ravin up
Thine own lifeís means!óThen ítis most like
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.

MACDUFF.
He is already namíd; and gone to Scone
To be invested.

ROSS.
Where is Duncanís body?

MACDUFF.
Carried to Colmekill,
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,
And guardian of their bones.

ROSS.
Will you to Scone?

MACDUFF.
No, cousin, Iíll to Fife.

ROSS.
Well, I will thither.

MACDUFF.
Well, may you see things well done there. Adieu!
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!

ROSS.
Farewell, father.

OLD MAN.
Godís benison go with you; and with those
That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!

[Exeunt.]

ACT III
SCENE I. Forres. A Room in the Palace.
Enter Banquo.

BANQUO.
Thou hast it now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
As the Weird Women promisíd; and, I fear,
Thou playídst most foully forít; yet it was said
It should not stand in thy posterity;
But that myself should be the root and father
Of many kings. If there come truth from them
(As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine)
Why, by the verities on thee made good,
May they not be my oracles as well,
And set me up in hope? But hush; no more.

Sennet sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Macbeth as Queen; Lennox, Ross, Lords, and Attendants.

MACBETH.
Hereís our chief guest.

LADY MACBETH.
If he had been forgotten,
It had been as a gap in our great feast,
And all-thing unbecoming.

MACBETH.
Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,
And Iíll request your presence.

BANQUO.
Let your Highness
Command upon me, to the which my duties
Are with a most indissoluble tie
For ever knit.

MACBETH.
Ride you this afternoon?

BANQUO.
Ay, my good lord.

MACBETH.
We should have else desiríd your good advice
(Which still hath been both grave and prosperous)
In this dayís council; but weíll take tomorrow.
Isít far you ride?

BANQUO.
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
íTwixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,
I must become a borrower of the night,
For a dark hour or twain.

MACBETH.
Fail not our feast.

BANQUO.
My lord, I will not.

MACBETH.
We hear our bloody cousins are bestowíd
In England and in Ireland; not confessing
Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
With strange invention. But of that tomorrow,
When therewithal we shall have cause of state
Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,
Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?

BANQUO.
Ay, my good lord: our time does call uponís.

MACBETH.
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
And so I do commend you to their backs.
Farewell.ó

[Exit Banquo.]

Let every man be master of his time
Till seven at night; to make society
The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
Till supper time alone: while then, God be with you.

[Exeunt Lady Macbeth, Lords, &c.]

Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men
Our pleasure?

SERVANT.
They are, my lord, without the palace gate.

MACBETH.
Bring them before us.

[Exit Servant.]

To be thus is nothing,
But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo
Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
Reigns that which would be fearíd: ítis much he dares;
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
To act in safety. There is none but he
Whose being I do fear: and under him
My genius is rebukíd; as, it is said,
Mark Antonyís was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
When first they put the name of king upon me,
And bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like,
They hailíd him father to a line of kings:
Upon my head they placíd a fruitless crown,
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
Thence to be wrenchíd with an unlineal hand,
No son of mine succeeding. Ifít be so,
For Banquoís issue have I filíd my mind;
For them the gracious Duncan have I murderíd;
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
Given to the common enemy of man,
To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
Rather than so, come, fate, into the list,
And champion me to thí utterance!óWhoís there?ó

Enter Servant with two Murderers.

Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.

[Exit Servant.]

Was it not yesterday we spoke together?

FIRST MURDERER.
It was, so please your Highness.

MACBETH.
Well then, now
Have you consideríd of my speeches? Know
That it was he, in the times past, which held you
So under fortune, which you thought had been
Our innocent self? This I made good to you
In our last conference, passíd in probation with you
How you were borne in hand, how crossíd, the instruments,
Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
To half a soul and to a notion crazíd
Say, ìThus did Banquo.î

FIRST MURDERER.
You made it known to us.

MACBETH.
I did so; and went further, which is now
Our point of second meeting. Do you find
Your patience so predominant in your nature,
That you can let this go? Are you so gospellíd,
To pray for this good man and for his issue,
Whose heavy hand hath bowíd you to the grave,
And beggaríd yours forever?

FIRST MURDERER.
We are men, my liege.

MACBETH.
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;
As hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept
All by the name of dogs: the valuíd file
Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
According to the gift which bounteous nature
Hath in him closíd; whereby he does receive
Particular addition, from the bill
That writes them all alike: and so of men.
Now, if you have a station in the file,
Not ií thí worst rank of manhood, sayít;
And I will put that business in your bosoms,
Whose execution takes your enemy off,
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
Which in his death were perfect.

SECOND MURDERER.
I am one, my liege,
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
Hath so incensíd that I am reckless what
I do to spite the world.

FIRST MURDERER.
And I another,
So weary with disasters, tuggíd with fortune,
That I would set my life on any chance,
To mend it or be rid onít.

MACBETH.
Both of you
Know Banquo was your enemy.

BOTH MURDERERS.
True, my lord.

MACBETH.
So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
That every minute of his being thrusts
Against my nearíst of life; and though I could
With barefacíd power sweep him from my sight,
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
For certain friends that are both his and mine,
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
Who I myself struck down: and thence it is
That I to your assistance do make love,
Masking the business from the common eye
For sundry weighty reasons.

SECOND MURDERER.
We shall, my lord,
Perform what you command us.

FIRST MURDERER.
Though our livesó

MACBETH.
Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most,
I will advise you where to plant yourselves,
Acquaint you with the perfect spy oí thí time,
The moment onít; forít must be done tonight
And something from the palace; always thought
That I require a clearness. And with him
(To leave no rubs nor botches in the work)
Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
Whose absence is no less material to me
Than is his fatherís, must embrace the fate
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.
Iíll come to you anon.

BOTH MURDERERS.
We are resolvíd, my lord.

MACBETH.
Iíll call upon you straight: abide within.

[Exeunt Murderers.]

It is concluded. Banquo, thy soulís flight,
If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.

[Exit.]

SCENE II. The same. Another Room in the Palace.
Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant.

LADY MACBETH.
Is Banquo gone from court?

SERVANT.
Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.

LADY MACBETH.
Say to the King, I would attend his leisure
For a few words.

SERVANT.
Madam, I will.

[Exit.]

LADY MACBETH.
Naughtís had, allís spent,
Where our desire is got without content:
íTis safer to be that which we destroy,
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.

Enter Macbeth.

How now, my lord, why do you keep alone,
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
With them they think on? Things without all remedy
Should be without regard: whatís done is done.

MACBETH.
We have scorchíd the snake, not killíd it.
Sheíll close, and be herself; whilst our poor malice
Remains in danger of her former tooth.
But let the frame of things disjoint,
Both the worlds suffer,
Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep
In the affliction of these terrible dreams
That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
After lifeís fitful fever he sleeps well;
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing
Can touch him further.

LADY MACBETH.
Come on,
Gently my lord, sleek oíer your rugged looks;
Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.

MACBETH.
So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you.
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
Unsafe the while, that we
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
Disguising what they are.

LADY MACBETH.
You must leave this.

MACBETH.
O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
Thou knowíst that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.

LADY MACBETH.
But in them natureís copyís not eterne.

MACBETH.
Thereís comfort yet; they are assailable.
Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown
His cloisteríd flight, ere to black Hecateís summons
The shard-born beetle, with his drowsy hums,
Hath rung nightís yawning peal, there shall be done
A deed of dreadful note.

LADY MACBETH.
Whatís to be done?

MACBETH.
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Which keeps me pale!óLight thickens; and the crow
Makes wing to thí rooky wood.
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,
Whiles nightís black agents to their preys do rouse.
Thou marvellíst at my words: but hold thee still;
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
So, príythee, go with me.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE III. The same. A Park or Lawn, with a gate leading to the Palace.
Enter three Murderers.

FIRST MURDERER.
But who did bid thee join with us?

THIRD MURDERER.
Macbeth.

SECOND MURDERER.
He needs not our mistrust; since he delivers
Our offices and what we have to do
To the direction just.

FIRST MURDERER.
Then stand with us.
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.
Now spurs the lated traveller apace,
To gain the timely inn; and near approaches
The subject of our watch.

THIRD MURDERER.
Hark! I hear horses.

BANQUO.
[Within.] Give us a light there, ho!

SECOND MURDERER.
Then ítis he; the rest
That are within the note of expectation
Already are ií thí court.

FIRST MURDERER.
His horses go about.

THIRD MURDERER.
Almost a mile; but he does usually,
So all men do, from hence to the palace gate
Make it their walk.

Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch.

SECOND MURDERER.
A light, a light!

THIRD MURDERER.
íTis he.

FIRST MURDERER.
Stand toít.

BANQUO.
It will be rain tonight.

FIRST MURDERER.
Let it come down.

[Assaults Banquo.]

BANQUO.
O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Thou mayst revengeóO slave!

[Dies. Fleance escapes.]

THIRD MURDERER.
Who did strike out the light?

FIRST MURDERER.
Wasít not the way?

THIRD MURDERER.
Thereís but one down: the son is fled.

SECOND MURDERER.
We have lost best half of our affair.

FIRST MURDERER.
Well, letís away, and say how much is done.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE IV. The same. A Room of state in the Palace.
A banquet prepared. Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Ross, Lennox, Lords and Attendants.

MACBETH.
You know your own degrees, sit down. At first
And last the hearty welcome.

LORDS.
Thanks to your Majesty.

MACBETH.
Ourself will mingle with society,
And play the humble host.
Our hostess keeps her state; but, in best time,
We will require her welcome.

LADY MACBETH.
Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;
For my heart speaks they are welcome.

Enter first Murderer to the door.

MACBETH.
See, they encounter thee with their heartsí thanks.
Both sides are even: here Iíll sit ií thí midst.

Be large in mirth; anon weíll drink a measure
The table round. Thereís blood upon thy face.

MURDERER.
íTis Banquoís then.

MACBETH.
íTis better thee without than he within.
Is he dispatchíd?

MURDERER.
My lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him.

MACBETH.
Thou art the best oí thí cut-throats;
Yet heís good that did the like for Fleance:
If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.

MURDERER.
Most royal sir,
Fleance is íscapíd.

MACBETH.
Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect;
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
As broad and general as the casing air:
But now I am cabiníd, cribbíd, confiníd, bound in
To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquoís safe?

MURDERER.
Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,
With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
The least a death to nature.

MACBETH.
Thanks for that.
There the grown serpent lies; the worm thatís fled
Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
No teeth for thí present.óGet thee gone; tomorrow
Weíll hear, ourselves, again.

[Exit Murderer.]

LADY MACBETH.
My royal lord,
You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
That is not often vouchíd, while ítis a-making,
íTis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
Meeting were bare without it.

The Ghost of Banquo rises, and sits in Macbethís place.

MACBETH.
Sweet remembrancer!ó
Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
And health on both!

LENNOX.
Mayít please your Highness sit.

MACBETH.
Here had we now our countryís honour roofíd,
Were the gracíd person of our Banquo present;
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
Than pity for mischance!

ROSS.
His absence, sir,
Lays blame upon his promise. Pleaseít your Highness
To grace us with your royal company?

MACBETH.
The tableís full.

LENNOX.
Here is a place reservíd, sir.

MACBETH.
Where?

LENNOX.
Here, my good lord. What isít that moves your Highness?

MACBETH.
Which of you have done this?

LORDS.
What, my good lord?

MACBETH.
Thou canst not say I did it. Never shake
Thy gory locks at me.

ROSS.
Gentlemen, rise; his Highness is not well.

LADY MACBETH.
Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus,
And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;
The fit is momentary; upon a thought
He will again be well. If much you note him,
You shall offend him, and extend his passion.
Feed, and regard him not.óAre you a man?

MACBETH.
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
Which might appal the devil.

LADY MACBETH.
O proper stuff!
This is the very painting of your fear:
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said,
Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws, and starts
(Impostors to true fear), would well become
A womanís story at a winterís fire,
Authorisíd by her grandam. Shame itself!
Why do you make such faces? When allís done,
You look but on a stool.

MACBETH.
Príythee, see there!
Behold! look! lo! how say you?
Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.ó
If charnel houses and our graves must send
Those that we bury back, our monuments
Shall be the maws of kites.

[Ghost disappears.]

LADY MACBETH.
What, quite unmanníd in folly?

MACBETH.
If I stand here, I saw him.

LADY MACBETH.
Fie, for shame!

MACBETH.
Blood hath been shed ere now, ií thí olden time,
Ere humane statute purgíd the gentle weal;
Ay, and since too, murders have been performíd
Too terrible for the ear: the time has been,
That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
And there an end; but now they rise again,
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
And push us from our stools. This is more strange
Than such a murder is.

LADY MACBETH.
My worthy lord,
Your noble friends do lack you.

MACBETH.
I do forget.ó
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;
Then Iíll sit down.óGive me some wine, fill full.ó
I drink to the general joy oí thí whole table,
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss:
Would he were here.

Ghost rises again.

To all, and him, we thirst,
And all to all.

LORDS.
Our duties, and the pledge.

MACBETH.
Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
Which thou dost glare with!

LADY MACBETH.
Think of this, good peers,
But as a thing of custom: ítis no other,
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.

MACBETH.
What man dare, I dare:
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
The armíd rhinoceros, or thí Hyrcan tiger;
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
Shall never tremble: or be alive again,
And dare me to the desert with thy sword;
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!
Unreal mockíry, hence!

[Ghost disappears.]

Why, so;óbeing gone,
I am a man again.óPray you, sit still.

LADY MACBETH.
You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting
With most admiríd disorder.

MACBETH.
Can such things be,
And overcome us like a summerís cloud,
Without our special wonder? You make me strange
Even to the disposition that I owe,
When now I think you can behold such sights,
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
When mine are blanchíd with fear.

ROSS.
What sights, my lord?

LADY MACBETH.
I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
Question enrages him. At once, good night:ó
Stand not upon the order of your going,
But go at once.

LENNOX.
Good night; and better health
Attend his Majesty!

LADY MACBETH.
A kind good night to all!

[Exeunt all Lords and Atendants.]

MACBETH.
It will have blood, they say, blood will have blood.
Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak;
Augurs, and understood relations, have
By magot-pies, and choughs, and rooks, brought forth
The secretíst man of blood.óWhat is the night?

LADY MACBETH.
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.

MACBETH.
How sayíst thou, that Macduff denies his person
At our great bidding?

LADY MACBETH.
Did you send to him, sir?

MACBETH.
I hear it by the way; but I will send.
Thereís not a one of them but in his house
I keep a servant feeíd. I will tomorrow
(And betimes I will) to the Weird Sisters:
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,
All causes shall give way: I am in blood
Steppíd in so far that, should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go oíer.
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Which must be acted ere they may be scanníd.

LADY MACBETH.
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.

MACBETH.
Come, weíll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.
We are yet but young in deed.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE V. The heath.
Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting Hecate.

FIRST WITCH.
Why, how now, Hecate? you look angerly.

HECATE.
Have I not reason, beldams as you are,
Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
To trade and traffic with Macbeth
In riddles and affairs of death;
And I, the mistress of your charms,
The close contriver of all harms,
Was never callíd to bear my part,
Or show the glory of our art?
And, which is worse, all you have done
Hath been but for a wayward son,
Spiteful and wrathful; who, as others do,
Loves for his own ends, not for you.
But make amends now: get you gone,
And at the pit of Acheron
Meet me ií thí morning: thither he
Will come to know his destiny.
Your vessels and your spells provide,
Your charms, and everything beside.
I am for thí air; this night Iíll spend
Unto a dismal and a fatal end.
Great business must be wrought ere noon.
Upon the corner of the moon
There hangs a vapírous drop profound;
Iíll catch it ere it come to ground:
And that, distillíd by magic sleights,
Shall raise such artificial sprites,
As, by the strength of their illusion,
Shall draw him on to his confusion.
He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
His hopes íbove wisdom, grace, and fear.
And you all know, security
Is mortalsí chiefest enemy.

[Music and song within, ìCome away, come awayî &c.]

Hark! I am callíd; my little spirit, see,
Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.

[Exit.]

FIRST WITCH.
Come, letís make haste; sheíll soon be back again.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE VI. Forres. A Room in the Palace.
Enter Lennox and another Lord.

LENNOX.
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
Which can interpret farther: only, I say,
Thingís have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan
Was pitied of Macbeth:ómarry, he was dead:ó
And the right valiant Banquo walkíd too late;
Whom, you may say, ifít please you, Fleance killíd,
For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.
Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight,
In pious rage, the two delinquents tear
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;
For ítwould have angeríd any heart alive,
To hear the men denyít. So that, I say,
He has borne all things well: and I do think,
That had he Duncanís sons under his key
(As, andít please heaven, he shall not) they should find
What ítwere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
But, peace!ófor from broad words, and ícause he failíd
His presence at the tyrantís feast, I hear,
Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell
Where he bestows himself?

LORD.
The son of Duncan,
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,
Lives in the English court and is receivíd
Of the most pious Edward with such grace
That the malevolence of fortune nothing
Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff
Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
To wake Northumberland, and warlike Siward
That, by the help of these (with Him above
To ratify the work), we may again
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights;
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
Do faithful homage, and receive free honours,
All which we pine for now. And this report
Hath so exasperate the King that he
Prepares for some attempt of war.

LENNOX.
Sent he to Macduff?

LORD.
He did: and with an absolute ìSir, not I,î
The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
And hums, as who should say, ìYouíll rue the time
That clogs me with this answer.î

LENNOX.
And that well might
Advise him to a caution, tí hold what distance
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
Fly to the court of England, and unfold
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
May soon return to this our suffering country
Under a hand accursíd!

LORD.
Iíll send my prayers with him.

[Exeunt.]

ACT IV
SCENE I. A dark Cave. In the middle, a Cauldron Boiling.
Thunder. Enter the three Witches.

FIRST WITCH.
Thrice the brinded cat hath mewíd.

SECOND WITCH.
Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whiníd.

THIRD WITCH.
Harpier cries:óíTis time, ítis time.

FIRST WITCH.
Round about the cauldron go;
In the poisoníd entrails throw.ó
Toad, that under cold stone
Days and nights has thirty-one
Swelteríd venom sleeping got,
Boil thou first ií thí charmed pot!

ALL.
Double, double, toil and trouble;
Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble.

SECOND WITCH.
Fillet of a fenny snake,
In the cauldron boil and bake;
Eye of newt, and toe of frog,
Wool of bat, and tongue of dog,
Adderís fork, and blind-wormís sting,
Lizardís leg, and howletís wing,
For a charm of powerful trouble,
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

ALL.
Double, double, toil and trouble;
Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble.

THIRD WITCH.
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
Witchís mummy, maw and gulf
Of the raviníd salt-sea shark,
Root of hemlock diggíd ií thí dark,
Liver of blaspheming Jew,
Gall of goat, and slips of yew
Sliveríd in the moonís eclipse,
Nose of Turk, and Tartarís lips,
Finger of birth-strangled babe
Ditch-deliveríd by a drab,
Make the gruel thick and slab:
Add thereto a tigerís chaudron,
For thí ingredients of our cauldron.

ALL.
Double, double, toil and trouble;
Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble.

SECOND WITCH.
Cool it with a baboonís blood.
Then the charm is firm and good.

Enter Hecate.

HECATE.
O, well done! I commend your pains,
And everyone shall share ií thí gains.
And now about the cauldron sing,
Like elves and fairies in a ring,
Enchanting all that you put in.

[Music and a song: ìBlack Spirits,î &c.]

[Exit Hecate.]

SECOND WITCH.
By the pricking of my thumbs,
Something wicked this way comes.
Open, locks,
Whoever knocks!

Enter Macbeth.

MACBETH.
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
What isít you do?

ALL.
A deed without a name.

MACBETH.
I conjure you, by that which you profess,
(Howeíer you come to know it) answer me:
Though you untie the winds, and let them fight
Against the churches; though the yesty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up;
Though bladed corn be lodgíd, and trees blown down;
Though castles topple on their wardersí heads;
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
Of natureís germens tumble all together,
Even till destruction sicken, answer me
To what I ask you.

FIRST WITCH.
Speak.

SECOND WITCH.
Demand.

THIRD WITCH.
Weíll answer.

FIRST WITCH.
Say, if thouídst rather hear it from our mouths,
Or from our masters?

MACBETH.
Call íem, let me see íem.

FIRST WITCH.
Pour in sowís blood, that hath eaten
Her nine farrow; grease thatís sweaten
From the murdererís gibbet throw
Into the flame.

ALL.
Come, high or low;
Thyself and office deftly show!

[Thunder. An Apparition of an armed Head rises.]

MACBETH.
Tell me, thou unknown power,ó

FIRST WITCH.
He knows thy thought:
Hear his speech, but say thou naught.

APPARITION.
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff;
Beware the Thane of Fife.óDismiss me.óEnough.

[Descends.]

MACBETH.
Whateíer thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
Thou hast harpíd my fear aright.óBut one word more.

FIRST WITCH.
He will not be commanded. Hereís another,
More potent than the first.

[Thunder. An Apparition of a bloody Child rises.]

APPARITION.
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!

MACBETH.
Had I three ears, Iíd hear thee.

APPARITION.
Be bloody, bold, and resolute. Laugh to scorn
The power of man, for none of woman born
Shall harm Macbeth.

[Descends.]

MACBETH.
Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
But yet Iíll make assurance double sure,
And take a bond of fate. Thou shalt not live;
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
And sleep in spite of thunder.

[Thunder. An Apparition of a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand, rises.]

What is this,
That rises like the issue of a king,
And wears upon his baby brow the round
And top of sovereignty?

ALL.
Listen, but speak not toít.

APPARITION.
Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care
Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:
Macbeth shall never vanquishíd be, until
Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
Shall come against him.

[Descends.]

MACBETH.
That will never be:
Who can impress the forest; bid the tree
Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements, good!
Rebellious head, rise never till the wood
Of Birnam rise, and our high-placíd Macbeth
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
To time and mortal custom.óYet my heart
Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
Can tell so much, shall Banquoís issue ever
Reign in this kingdom?

ALL.
Seek to know no more.

MACBETH.
I will be satisfied: deny me this,
And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?

[Hautboys.]

FIRST WITCH.
Show!

SECOND WITCH.
Show!

THIRD WITCH.
Show!

ALL.
Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
Come like shadows, so depart!

[A show of eight kings appear, and pass over in order, the last with a glass in his hand; Banquo following.]

MACBETH.
Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo. Down!
Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs:óand thy hair,
Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
A third is like the former.óFilthy hags!
Why do you show me this?óA fourth!óStart, eyes!
What, will the line stretch out to thí crack of doom?
Another yet!óA seventh!óIíll see no more:ó
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
Which shows me many more; and some I see
That twofold balls and treble sceptres carry.
Horrible sight!óNow I see ítis true;
For the blood-bolteríd Banquo smiles upon me,
And points at them for his.óWhat! is this so?

FIRST WITCH.
Ay, sir, all this is so:óbut why
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?ó
Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
And show the best of our delights.
Iíll charm the air to give a sound,
While you perform your antic round;
That this great king may kindly say,
Our duties did his welcome pay.

[Music. The Witches dance, and vanish.]

MACBETH.
Where are they? Gone?óLet this pernicious hour
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!ó
Come in, without there!

Enter Lennox.

LENNOX.
Whatís your Graceís will?

MACBETH.
Saw you the Weird Sisters?

LENNOX.
No, my lord.

MACBETH.
Came they not by you?

LENNOX.
No, indeed, my lord.

MACBETH.
Infected be the air whereon they ride;
And damníd all those that trust them!óI did hear
The galloping of horse: who wasít came by?

LENNOX.
íTis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
Macduff is fled to England.

MACBETH.
Fled to England!

LENNOX.
Ay, my good lord.

MACBETH.
Time, thou anticipatíst my dread exploits:
The flighty purpose never is oíertook
Unless the deed go with it. From this moment
The very firstlings of my heart shall be
The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
Seize upon Fife; give to thí edge oí thí sword
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
This deed Iíll do before this purpose cool:
But no more sights!óWhere are these gentlemen?
Come, bring me where they are.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE II. Fife. A Room in Macduffís Castle.
Enter Lady Macduff her Son and Ross.

LADY MACDUFF.
What had he done, to make him fly the land?

ROSS.
You must have patience, madam.

LADY MACDUFF.
He had none:
His flight was madness: when our actions do not,
Our fears do make us traitors.

ROSS.
You know not
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.

LADY MACDUFF.
Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
His mansion, and his titles, in a place
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not:
He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
All is the fear, and nothing is the love;
As little is the wisdom, where the flight
So runs against all reason.

ROSS.
My dearest coz,
I pray you, school yourself: but, for your husband,
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
The fits oí thí season. I dare not speak much further:
But cruel are the times, when we are traitors,
And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumour
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
But float upon a wild and violent sea
Each way and moveóI take my leave of you:
Shall not be long but Iíll be here again.
Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
To what they were before.óMy pretty cousin,
Blessing upon you!

LADY MACDUFF.
Fatheríd he is, and yet heís fatherless.

ROSS.
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
I take my leave at once.

[Exit.]

LADY MACDUFF.
Sirrah, your fatherís dead.
And what will you do now? How will you live?

SON.
As birds do, mother.

LADY MACDUFF.
What, with worms and flies?

SON.
With what I get, I mean; and so do they.

LADY MACDUFF.
Poor bird! thouídst never fear the net nor lime,
The pit-fall nor the gin.

SON.
Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.
My father is not dead, for all your saying.

LADY MACDUFF.
Yes, he is dead: how wilt thou do for a father?

SON.
Nay, how will you do for a husband?

LADY MACDUFF.
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.

SON.
Then youíll buy íem to sell again.

LADY MACDUFF.
Thou speakíst with all thy wit;
And yet, ií faith, with wit enough for thee.

SON.
Was my father a traitor, mother?

LADY MACDUFF.
Ay, that he was.

SON.
What is a traitor?

LADY MACDUFF.
Why, one that swears and lies.

SON.
And be all traitors that do so?

LADY MACDUFF.
Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.

SON.
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?

LADY MACDUFF.
Every one.

SON.
Who must hang them?

LADY MACDUFF.
Why, the honest men.

SON.
Then the liars and swearers are fools: for there are liars and swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them.

LADY MACDUFF.
Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do for a father?

SON.
If he were dead, youíld weep for him: if you would not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father.

LADY MACDUFF.
Poor prattler, how thou talkíst!

Enter a Messenger.

MESSENGER.
Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
Though in your state of honour I am perfect.
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
If you will take a homely manís advice,
Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;
To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
I dare abide no longer.

[Exit.]

LADY MACDUFF.
Whither should I fly?
I have done no harm. But I remember now
I am in this earthly world, where to do harm
Is often laudable; to do good sometime
Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,
Do I put up that womanly defence,
To say I have done no harm? What are these faces?

Enter Murderers.

FIRST MURDERER.
Where is your husband?

LADY MACDUFF.
I hope, in no place so unsanctified
Where such as thou mayst find him.

FIRST MURDERER.
Heís a traitor.

SON.
Thou liest, thou shag-earíd villain!

FIRST MURDERER.
What, you egg!

[Stabbing him.]

Young fry of treachery!

SON.
He has killíd me, mother:
Run away, I pray you!

[Dies. Exit Lady Macduff, crying ìMurder!î and pursued by the Murderers.]

SCENE III. England. Before the Kingís Palace.
Enter Malcolm and Macduff.

MALCOLM.
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
Weep our sad bosoms empty.

MACDUFF.
Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword, and, like good men,
Bestride our down-fallín birthdom. Each new morn
New widows howl, new orphans cry; new sorrows
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
As if it felt with Scotland, and yellíd out
Like syllable of dolour.

MALCOLM.
What I believe, Iíll wail;
What know, believe; and what I can redress,
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
What you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well;
He hath not touchíd you yet. I am young; but something
You may deserve of him through me; and wisdom
To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb
To appease an angry god.

MACDUFF.
I am not treacherous.

MALCOLM.
But Macbeth is.
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon.
That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell:
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
Yet grace must still look so.

MACDUFF.
I have lost my hopes.

MALCOLM.
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
Without leave-taking?óI pray you,
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
Whatever I shall think.

MACDUFF.
Bleed, bleed, poor country!
Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,
For goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;
The title is affeeríd.óFare thee well, lord:
I would not be the villain that thou thinkíst
For the whole space thatís in the tyrantís grasp
And the rich East to boot.

MALCOLM.
Be not offended:
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
Is added to her wounds. I think, withal,
There would be hands uplifted in my right;
And here, from gracious England, have I offer
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
When I shall tread upon the tyrantís head,
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
Shall have more vices than it had before,
More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,
By him that shall succeed.

MACDUFF.
What should he be?

MALCOLM.
It is myself I mean; in whom I know
All the particulars of vice so grafted
That, when they shall be openíd, black Macbeth
Will seem as pure as snow; and the poor state
Esteem him as a lamb, being comparíd
With my confineless harms.

MACDUFF.
Not in the legions
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damníd
In evils to top Macbeth.

MALCOLM.
I grant him bloody,
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
That has a name: but thereís no bottom, none,
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
Your matrons, and your maids, could not fill up
The cistern of my lust; and my desire
All continent impediments would oíerbear,
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
Than such an one to reign.

MACDUFF.
Boundless intemperance
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
Thí untimely emptying of the happy throne,
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
To take upon you what is yours: you may
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
And yet seem coldóthe time you may so hoodwink.
We have willing dames enough; there cannot be
That vulture in you, to devour so many
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
Finding it so incliníd.

MALCOLM.
With this there grows
In my most ill-composíd affection such
A staunchless avarice, that, were I king,
I should cut off the nobles for their lands;
Desire his jewels, and this otherís house:
And my more-having would be as a sauce
To make me hunger more; that I should forge
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
Destroying them for wealth.

MACDUFF.
This avarice
Sticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root
Than summer-seeming lust; and it hath been
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will,
Of your mere own. All these are portable,
With other graces weighíd.

MALCOLM.
But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
As justice, verity, tempírance, stableness,
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
I have no relish of them; but abound
In the division of each several crime,
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
Uproar the universal peace, confound
All unity on earth.

MACDUFF.
O Scotland, Scotland!

MALCOLM.
If such a one be fit to govern, speak:
I am as I have spoken.

MACDUFF.
Fit to govern?
No, not to live.óO nation miserable,
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepteríd,
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
Since that the truest issue of thy throne
By his own interdiction stands accusíd,
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,
Oftíner upon her knees than on her feet,
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
These evils thou repeatíst upon thyself
Have banishíd me from Scotland.óO my breast,
Thy hope ends here!

MALCOLM.
Macduff, this noble passion,
Child of integrity, hath from my soul
Wiped the black scruples, reconcilíd my thoughts
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
From over-credulous haste: but God above
Deal between thee and me! for even now
I put myself to thy direction, and
Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
For strangers to my nature. I am yet
Unknown to woman; never was forsworn;
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own;
At no time broke my faith; would not betray
The devil to his fellow; and delight
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
Was this upon myself. What I am truly,
Is thine and my poor countryís to command:
Whither, indeed, before thy here-approach,
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
Already at a point, was setting forth.
Now weíll together, and the chance of goodness
Be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?

MACDUFF.
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
íTis hard to reconcile.

Enter a Doctor.

MALCOLM.
Well; more anon.óComes the King forth, I pray you?

DOCTOR.
Ay, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls
That stay his cure: their malady convinces
The great assay of art; but at his touch,
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand,
They presently amend.

MALCOLM.
I thank you, doctor.

[Exit Doctor.]

MACDUFF.
Whatís the disease he means?

MALCOLM.
íTis callíd the evil:
A most miraculous work in this good king;
Which often, since my here-remain in England,
I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
Himself best knows, but strangely-visited people,
All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
The mere despair of surgery, he cures;
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
Put on with holy prayers: and ítis spoken,
To the succeeding royalty he leaves
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy;
And sundry blessings hang about his throne,
That speak him full of grace.

Enter Ross.

MACDUFF.
See, who comes here?

MALCOLM.
My countryman; but yet I know him not.

MACDUFF.
My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.

MALCOLM.
I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
The means that makes us strangers!

ROSS.
Sir, amen.

MACDUFF.
Stands Scotland where it did?

ROSS.
Alas, poor country,
Almost afraid to know itself! It cannot
Be callíd our mother, but our grave, where nothing,
But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
Where sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that rent the air,
Are made, not markíd; where violent sorrow seems
A modern ecstasy. The dead manís knell
Is there scarce askíd for who; and good menís lives
Expire before the flowers in their caps,
Dying or ere they sicken.

MACDUFF.
O, relation
Too nice, and yet too true!

MALCOLM.
Whatís the newest grief?

ROSS.
That of an hourís age doth hiss the speaker;
Each minute teems a new one.

MACDUFF.
How does my wife?

ROSS.
Why, well.

MACDUFF.
And all my children?

ROSS.
Well too.

MACDUFF.
The tyrant has not batteríd at their peace?

ROSS.
No; they were well at peace when I did leave íem.

MACDUFF.
Be not a niggard of your speech: how goesít?

ROSS.
When I came hither to transport the tidings,
Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
Of many worthy fellows that were out;
Which was to my belief witnessíd the rather,
For that I saw the tyrantís power afoot.
Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland
Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
To doff their dire distresses.

MALCOLM.
Beít their comfort
We are coming thither. Gracious England hath
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
An older and a better soldier none
That Christendom gives out.

ROSS.
Would I could answer
This comfort with the like! But I have words
That would be howlíd out in the desert air,
Where hearing should not latch them.

MACDUFF.
What concern they?
The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
Due to some single breast?

ROSS.
No mind thatís honest
But in it shares some woe, though the main part
Pertains to you alone.

MACDUFF.
If it be mine,
Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.

ROSS.
Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
That ever yet they heard.

MACDUFF.
Humh! I guess at it.

ROSS.
Your castle is surprisíd; your wife and babes
Savagely slaughteríd. To relate the manner
Were, on the quarry of these murderíd deer,
To add the death of you.

MALCOLM.
Merciful heaven!ó
What, man! neíer pull your hat upon your brows.
Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak
Whispers the oíer-fraught heart, and bids it break.

MACDUFF.
My children too?

ROSS.
Wife, children, servants, all
That could be found.

MACDUFF.
And I must be from thence!
My wife killíd too?

ROSS.
I have said.

MALCOLM.
Be comforted:
Letís make us medícines of our great revenge,
To cure this deadly grief.

MACDUFF.
He has no children.óAll my pretty ones?
Did you say all?óO hell-kite!óAll?
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
At one fell swoop?

MALCOLM.
Dispute it like a man.

MACDUFF.
I shall do so;
But I must also feel it as a man:
I cannot but remember such things were,
That were most precious to me.óDid heaven look on,
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
Fell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now!

MALCOLM.
Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.

MACDUFF.
O, I could play the woman with mine eyes,
And braggart with my tongue!óBut, gentle heavens,
Cut short all intermission; front to front,
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
Within my swordís length set him; if he íscape,
Heaven forgive him too!

MALCOLM.
This tune goes manly.
Come, go we to the King. Our power is ready;
Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may;
The night is long that never finds the day.

[Exeunt.]

ACT V
SCENE I. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle.
Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.

DOCTOR.
I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?

GENTLEWOMAN.
Since his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write uponít, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.

DOCTOR.
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching. In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?

GENTLEWOMAN.
That, sir, which I will not report after her.

DOCTOR.
You may to me; and ítis most meet you should.

GENTLEWOMAN.
Neither to you nor anyone; having no witness to confirm my speech.

Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.

Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.

DOCTOR.
How came she by that light?

GENTLEWOMAN.
Why, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; ítis her command.

DOCTOR.
You see, her eyes are open.

GENTLEWOMAN.
Ay, but their sense are shut.

DOCTOR.
What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.

GENTLEWOMAN.
It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.

LADY MACBETH.
Yet hereís a spot.

DOCTOR.
Hark, she speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.

LADY MACBETH.
Out, damned spot! out, I say! One; two. Why, then ítis time to doít. Hell is murky! Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?

DOCTOR.
Do you mark that?

LADY MACBETH.
The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?óWhat, will these hands neíer be clean? No more oí that, my lord, no more oí that: you mar all with this starting.

DOCTOR.
Go to, go to. You have known what you should not.

GENTLEWOMAN.
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that: heaven knows what she has known.

LADY MACBETH.
Hereís the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!

DOCTOR.
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.

GENTLEWOMAN.
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.

DOCTOR.
Well, well, well.

GENTLEWOMAN.
Pray God it be, sir.

DOCTOR.
This disease is beyond my practice: yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep, who have died holily in their beds.

LADY MACBETH.
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquoís buried; he cannot come out onís grave.

DOCTOR.
Even so?

LADY MACBETH.
To bed, to bed. Thereís knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come, give me your hand. Whatís done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed.

[Exit.]

DOCTOR.
Will she go now to bed?

GENTLEWOMAN.
Directly.

DOCTOR.
Foul whispírings are abroad. Unnatural deeds
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.
More needs she the divine than the physician.ó
God, God, forgive us all! Look after her;
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:
My mind she has mated, and amazíd my sight.
I think, but dare not speak.

GENTLEWOMAN.
Good night, good doctor.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE II. The Country near Dunsinane.
Enter, with drum and colours Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox and Soldiers.

MENTEITH.
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
Excite the mortified man.

ANGUS.
Near Birnam wood
Shall we well meet them. That way are they coming.

CAITHNESS.
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?

LENNOX.
For certain, sir, he is not. I have a file
Of all the gentry: there is Siwardís son
And many unrough youths, that even now
Protest their first of manhood.

MENTEITH.
What does the tyrant?

CAITHNESS.
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
Some say heís mad; others, that lesser hate him,
Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,
He cannot buckle his distemperíd cause
Within the belt of rule.

ANGUS.
Now does he feel
His secret murders sticking on his hands;
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
Those he commands move only in command,
Nothing in love: now does he feel his title
Hang loose about him, like a giantís robe
Upon a dwarfish thief.

MENTEITH.
Who, then, shall blame
His pesteríd senses to recoil and start,
When all that is within him does condemn
Itself for being there?

CAITHNESS.
Well, march we on,
To give obedience where ítis truly owíd:
Meet we the medícine of the sickly weal;
And with him pour we, in our countryís purge,
Each drop of us.

LENNOX.
Or so much as it needs
To dew the sovereign flower, and drown the weeds.
Make we our march towards Birnam.

[Exeunt, marching.]

SCENE III. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle.
Enter Macbeth, Doctor and Attendants.

MACBETH.
Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane
I cannot taint with fear. Whatís the boy Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
All mortal consequences have pronouncíd me thus:
ìFear not, Macbeth; no man thatís born of woman
Shall eíer have power upon thee.îóThen fly, false thanes,
And mingle with the English epicures:
The mind I sway by, and the heart I bear,
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.

Enter a Servant.

The devil damn thee black, thou cream-facíd loon!
Where gottíst thou that goose look?

SERVANT.
There is ten thousandó

MACBETH.
Geese, villain?

SERVANT.
Soldiers, sir.

MACBETH.
Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,
Thou lily-liveríd boy. What soldiers, patch?
Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?

SERVANT.
The English force, so please you.

MACBETH.
Take thy face hence.

[Exit Servant.]

Seyton!óI am sick at heart,
When I beholdóSeyton, I say!óThis push
Will cheer me ever or disseat me now.
I have livíd long enough: my way of life
Is fallín into the sere, the yellow leaf;
And that which should accompany old age,
As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.
Seyton!ó

Enter Seyton.

SEYTON.
Whatís your gracious pleasure?

MACBETH.
What news more?

SEYTON.
All is confirmíd, my lord, which was reported.

MACBETH.
Iíll fight till from my bones my flesh be hackíd.
Give me my armour.

SEYTON.
íTis not needed yet.

MACBETH.
Iíll put it on.
Send out more horses, skirr the country round;
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.ó
How does your patient, doctor?

DOCTOR.
Not so sick, my lord,
As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,
That keep her from her rest.

MACBETH.
Cure her of that:
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseasíd,
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
Raze out the written troubles of the brain,
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
Cleanse the stuffíd bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart?

DOCTOR.
Therein the patient
Must minister to himself.

MACBETH.
Throw physic to the dogs, Iíll none of it.
Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff:
Seyton, send out.óDoctor, the Thanes fly from me.ó
Come, sir, despatch.óIf thou couldst, doctor, cast
The water of my land, find her disease,
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
I would applaud thee to the very echo,
That should applaud again.óPullít off, I say.ó
What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug,
Would scour these English hence? Hearíst thou of them?

DOCTOR.
Ay, my good lord. Your royal preparation
Makes us hear something.

MACBETH.
Bring it after me.ó
I will not be afraid of death and bane,
Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.

[Exeunt all except Doctor.]

DOCTOR.
Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
Profit again should hardly draw me here.

[Exit.]

SCENE IV. Country near Dunsinane: a Wood in view.
Enter, with drum and colours Malcolm, old Siward and his Son, Macduff, Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox, Ross and Soldiers, marching.

MALCOLM.
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
That chambers will be safe.

MENTEITH.
We doubt it nothing.

SIWARD.
What wood is this before us?

MENTEITH.
The wood of Birnam.

MALCOLM.
Let every soldier hew him down a bough,
And bearít before him. Thereby shall we shadow
The numbers of our host, and make discovery
Err in report of us.

SOLDIERS.
It shall be done.

SIWARD.
We learn no other but the confident tyrant
Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
Our setting down beforeít.

MALCOLM.
íTis his main hope;
For where there is advantage to be given,
Both more and less have given him the revolt,
And none serve with him but constrained things,
Whose hearts are absent too.

MACDUFF.
Let our just censures
Attend the true event, and put we on
Industrious soldiership.

SIWARD.
The time approaches,
That will with due decision make us know
What we shall say we have, and what we owe.
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate;
Towards which advance the war.

[Exeunt, marching.]

SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle.
Enter with drum and colours, Macbeth, Seyton and Soldiers.

MACBETH.
Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
The cry is still, ìThey come!î Our castleís strength
Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
Till famine and the ague eat them up.
Were they not forcíd with those that should be ours,
We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
And beat them backward home.

[A cry of women within.]

What is that noise?

SEYTON.
It is the cry of women, my good lord.

[Exit.]

MACBETH.
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
The time has been, my senses would have coolíd
To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
As life were inít. I have suppíd full with horrors;
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,
Cannot once start me.

Enter Seyton.

Wherefore was that cry?

SEYTON.
The Queen, my lord, is dead.

MACBETH.
She should have died hereafter.
There would have been a time for such a word.
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Lifeís but a walking shadow; a poor player,
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more: it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.

Enter a Messenger.

Thou comíst to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.

MESSENGER.
Gracious my lord,
I should report that which I say I saw,
But know not how to doít.

MACBETH.
Well, say, sir.

MESSENGER.
As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
I lookíd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
The wood began to move.

MACBETH.
Liar, and slave!

MESSENGER.
Let me endure your wrath, ifít be not so.
Within this three mile may you see it coming;
I say, a moving grove.

MACBETH.
If thou speakíst false,
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
I care not if thou dost for me as much.ó
I pull in resolution; and begin
To doubt thí equivocation of the fiend,
That lies like truth. ìFear not, till Birnam wood
Do come to Dunsinane;î and now a wood
Comes toward Dunsinane.óArm, arm, and out!ó
If this which he avouches does appear,
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
I ígin to be aweary of the sun,
And wish thí estate oí thí world were now undone.ó
Ring the alarum bell!óBlow, wind! come, wrack!
At least weíll die with harness on our back.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE VI. The same. A Plain before the Castle.
Enter, with drum and colours, Malcolm, old Siward, Macduff and their Army, with boughs.

MALCOLM.
Now near enough. Your leafy screens throw down,
And show like those you are.óYou, worthy uncle,
Shall with my cousin, your right noble son,
Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
Shall take uponís what else remains to do,
According to our order.

SIWARD.
Fare you well.ó
Do we but find the tyrantís power tonight,
Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.

MACDUFF.
Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE VII. The same. Another part of the Plain.
Alarums. Enter Macbeth.

MACBETH.
They have tied me to a stake. I cannot fly,
But, bear-like I must fight the course.óWhatís he
That was not born of woman? Such a one
Am I to fear, or none.

Enter young Siward.

YOUNG SIWARD.
What is thy name?

MACBETH.
Thouílt be afraid to hear it.

YOUNG SIWARD.
No; though thou callíst thyself a hotter name
Than any is in hell.

MACBETH.
My nameís Macbeth.

YOUNG SIWARD.
The devil himself could not pronounce a title
More hateful to mine ear.

MACBETH.
No, nor more fearful.

YOUNG SIWARD.
Thou liest, abhorred tyrant. With my sword
Iíll prove the lie thou speakíst.

[They fight, and young Siward is slain.]

MACBETH.
Thou wast born of woman.
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
Brandishíd by man thatís of a woman born.

[Exit.]

Alarums. Enter Macduff.

MACDUFF.
That way the noise is.óTyrant, show thy face!
If thou beíst slain and with no stroke of mine,
My wife and childrenís ghosts will haunt me still.
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,
Or else my sword, with an unbatteríd edge,
I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
By this great clatter, one of greatest note
Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune!
And more I beg not.

[Exit. Alarums.]

Enter Malcolm and old Siward.

SIWARD.
This way, my lord;óthe castleís gently renderíd:
The tyrantís people on both sides do fight;
The noble thanes do bravely in the war,
The day almost itself professes yours,
And little is to do.

MALCOLM.
We have met with foes
That strike beside us.

SIWARD.
Enter, sir, the castle.

[Exeunt. Alarums.]

SCENE VIII. The same. Another part of the field.
Enter Macbeth.

MACBETH.
Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes
Do better upon them.

Enter Macduff.

MACDUFF.
Turn, hell-hound, turn!

MACBETH.
Of all men else I have avoided thee:
But get thee back; my soul is too much chargíd
With blood of thine already.

MACDUFF.
I have no words;
My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
Than terms can give thee out!

[They fight.]

MACBETH.
Thou losest labour:
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
With thy keen sword impress, as make me bleed:
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
I bear a charmed life, which must not yield
To one of woman born.

MACDUFF.
Despair thy charm;
And let the angel whom thou still hast servíd
Tell thee, Macduff was from his motherís womb
Untimely rippíd.

MACBETH.
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
For it hath cowíd my better part of man!
And be these juggling fiends no more believíd,
That palter with us in a double sense;
That keep the word of promise to our ear,
And break it to our hope!óIíll not fight with thee.

MACDUFF.
Then yield thee, coward,
And live to be the show and gaze oí thí time.
Weíll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
Painted upon a pole, and underwrit,
ìHere may you see the tyrant.î

MACBETH.
I will not yield,
To kiss the ground before young Malcolmís feet,
And to be baited with the rabbleís curse.
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
And thou opposíd, being of no woman born,
Yet I will try the last. Before my body
I throw my warlike shield: lay on, Macduff;
And damníd be him that first cries, ìHold, enough!î

[Exeunt fighting. Alarums.]

Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, Malcolm, old Siward, Ross, Thanes and Soldiers.

MALCOLM.
I would the friends we miss were safe arrivíd.

SIWARD.
Some must go off; and yet, by these I see,
So great a day as this is cheaply bought.

MALCOLM.
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.

ROSS.
Your son, my lord, has paid a soldierís debt:
He only livíd but till he was a man;
The which no sooner had his prowess confirmíd
In the unshrinking station where he fought,
But like a man he died.

SIWARD.
Then he is dead?

FLEANCE.
Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow
Must not be measuríd by his worth, for then
It hath no end.

SIWARD.
Had he his hurts before?

ROSS.
Ay, on the front.

SIWARD.
Why then, Godís soldier be he!
Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
I would not wish them to a fairer death:
And so his knell is knollíd.

MALCOLM.
Heís worth more sorrow,
And that Iíll spend for him.

SIWARD.
Heís worth no more.
They say he parted well and paid his score:
And so, God be with him!óHere comes newer comfort.

Enter Macduff with Macbethís head.

MACDUFF.
Hail, King, for so thou art. Behold, where stands
Thí usurperís cursed head: the time is free.
I see thee compassíd with thy kingdomís pearl,
That speak my salutation in their minds;
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine,ó
Hail, King of Scotland!

ALL.
Hail, King of Scotland!

[Flourish.]

MALCOLM.
We shall not spend a large expense of time
Before we reckon with your several loves,
And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
In such an honour namíd. Whatís more to do,
Which would be planted newly with the time,ó
As calling home our exilíd friends abroad,
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
Producing forth the cruel ministers
Of this dead butcher, and his fiend-like queen,
Who, as ítis thought, by self and violent hands
Took off her life;óthis, and what needful else
That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
We will perform in measure, time, and place.
So thanks to all at once, and to each one,
Whom we invite to see us crowníd at Scone.

[Flourish. Exeunt.]
